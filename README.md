# Soap Battle 🧼💥

**Unity Status**

2D multiplayer arena game prototype built in Unity

---

## 🎮 Description

**Soap Battle** is a fast-paced 2D arena game prototype where players control sentient soap bars battling inside dirty environments.

The core objective is to clean the arena while fighting other players, using slippery movement, physics-based combat, and playful chaos.  
Players score points by cleaning dirty tiles and by outplaying opponents in close-quarters battles.

The game is designed with **local multiplayer** in mind, inspired by titles like *Rivals of Aether* and *Super Smash Bros.*, but with a humorous and tactile twist centered around soap, bubbles, and cleanliness.

## 🕹 Main Gameplay Mechanics

### Local Multiplayer (2–4 players)
Multiple players spawned dynamically, each with independent input, camera tracking, and score UI.

### Arena Combat
Fast movement, knockback-based combat, projectiles, and item interactions.

### Cleaning System
Dirty floor tiles evolve through multiple cleaning stages as players walk over them, rewarding points.

### Physics-driven Movement
Slippery controls, momentum, falling off the stage, and respawning mechanics.

### Dynamic Camera
Smash-like camera system that:
- Tracks active players  
- Adjusts zoom dynamically  
- Ignores players that fall into the abyss  

### Scoring System
Each player has an individual score UI (e.g. **P1 Score**, **P2 Score**), updated in real time.
